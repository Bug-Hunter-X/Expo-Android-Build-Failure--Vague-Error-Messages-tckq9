# Expo Android Build Failure: Vague Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android projects with Expo CLI: cryptic error messages during the build process. The error often lacks specificity, making it difficult to identify the root cause.

## Problem

The build process fails, and the error message isn't informative enough to diagnose the problem.  Common symptoms include missing SDK components, Gradle issues, or mismatched dependencies.  The lack of detailed error reporting makes debugging time-consuming.

## Solution

The primary solution focuses on ensuring that your Android development environment is correctly configured and that the required Android SDK components, build tools, and Gradle version are compatible with Expo's requirements.  This involves verifying SDK installations, cleaning build folders, and potentially updating dependencies.

This repository provides examples of both the problematic code (which might exhibit the vague error message during the build) and the solution to address the problem.  See the individual files for code examples and steps for troubleshooting.
