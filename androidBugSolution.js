To fix this, meticulously check your Android setup:

1. **Verify SDK Installation:** Ensure you have the correct Android SDK version installed, as specified by Expo's documentation for your project. Use the Android SDK Manager to check and install any missing components.
2. **Check Build Tools:** Confirm that the appropriate Android build tools are installed. Outdated build tools can cause incompatibility.
3. **Gradle Version:** Check your `android/build.gradle` file (within your Expo project) to ensure that the Gradle version is compatible.  Incompatibilities between Gradle and the Android SDK or build tools frequently cause build failures.
4. **Clean Build:** Before retrying the build, execute a clean operation in your terminal using `expo prebuild --clean` and then `expo run:android`
5. **Update Dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies in `package.json` are up-to-date. Run `expo upgrade` and then `npm install`.
6. **Check Environment Variables:** Ensure you've set the necessary environment variables for Android development. Check Expo's documentation for details based on your OS.
7. **Detailed Logging:** To get more verbose logs, you can try running `expo run:android --verbose` or using a debugging tool to step through the build process (if you're comfortable with that level of debugging).
8. **Examine Logs Carefully:** Carefully review all logs produced during the build process. Look for any clues, even seemingly unrelated messages, that might hint at the underlying issue.
